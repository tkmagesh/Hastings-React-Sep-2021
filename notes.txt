In JSX
    Every open tag must have a corresponding closing tag
    Use 'htmlFor' in place of 'for'
    Use 'className' in place of 'class'

Day-2 Agenda
    Dynamic display of components (done)
    Create a list of components (done)
    Assignment : SalaryCalculator using React (done)
    Component Composition (done)
    Functional Components
    Hooks
    Product Management Use Case (to understand the need for state manager)


React Hooks
    Functions created to handle side effects in functional components
    Hook function names must start with 'use'
    Builtin Hooks
        useState
        useEffect
        useMemo
        useCallback
        useReducer
        useRef

State
    UI State
        assists the presentational needs of the component
        
        Changes in this state is not required to be implicitly recognized by other parts of the application
        
        It is highly unlikely that this state is needed in other parts of the application

        It is perfectly ok to maintain this in the component state

    App State
        Data that is used in the core business logic of the application

        It is highly likely that this data is needed in other parts of the application

        Changes in this state MUST be implicitly recognized by other parts of the application

        DONOT maintain this in the component state

    Architectural guideline

Function Invocation patterns
    When a function is invoked    
        1. as a method of an obj
                this -> obj
        2. as a function
                this -> global scope (window)
